Last month, while writing a grant, I found myself stuck. Three half-finished paragraphs sat waiting for references. Normally, this would mean an hour trawling PubMed, copy-pasting titles, and staring at a blank page trying to integrate them. Instead, I pasted one citation I had already collected into ChatGPT and asked it to draft a paragraph placing the study in context. The result wasn't perfect, but it gave me a solid first draft and broke my writer's block.

That was my "aha" moment: GPT wasn't replacing my work, but it was shifting it. Less clerical time, more critical editing.

When ChatGPT first appeared in late 2022, it seemed like a potential shortcut for references. The reality was less helpful: the model confidently produced lists of references, but many were fabricated. Titles and journals looked convincing, but the articles didn't exist. In healthcare research, that's not just an error, it undermines trust.

Fast forward to 2025. The situation is changing. GPT can now connect to real databases, search the web, retrieve verifiable citations, and even support more advanced workflows. I now use it for three things: retrieving references without hallucination, integrating them into writing, and verifying citations during peer review.

As a peer reviewer, I often need to check whether references truly support an author's claim. Instead of pulling the paper manually, I can paste the claim and the citation into GPT and ask: "Summarise what this paper reports. Does it support the claim?" In one case, it flagged that the cited paper only showed moderate agreement with human reviewers, not superiority.

If GPT once symbolised unreliability through fake citations, it now symbolises a new challenge: how do we responsibly integrate a tool that is finally beginning to get the references right? The transformation is not about replacing researchers. It is about changing where we spend our energy: away from mechanical tasks, toward oversight and interpretation.
